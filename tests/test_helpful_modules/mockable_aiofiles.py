class MockableAioFiles:
    """
    A mockable class for asynchronous file operations, intended for unit tests.
    This class can be used as an asynchronous context manager.
    For actual production, please use the real aiofiles.open :)
    Usage Example:
    ```
    async with MockableAioFiles('example.txt', 'w') as mock_file:
        await mock_file.write('This is a mock file.')
    ```

    Attributes:
        file_name (str): The name of the file to be opened.
        mode (str): The mode in which the file is opened.
        args (List): Additional arguments for file opening.
        kwargs (Dict): Additional keyword arguments for file opening.
        file (io.StringIO | io.TextIOBase): The file object.

    Methods:
        __aenter__: Enters the context for file operations.
        __aexit__: Exits the context and ensures proper file closure.
        write: Writes the provided content to the file.
        read_byte: Reads the specified number of bytes from the file.

    Raises:
        RuntimeError: If an attempt is made to enter a context for the same file when it's already open,
                     or if there are issues with file opening, closing, writing, or reading.
        TypeError: If the content provided to the write method is not a string.
