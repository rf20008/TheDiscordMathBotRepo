# Privacy policy

Most of the content in this privacy policy should be self-explanatory. (Write to me if it isn't!)
If you use this application (the Discord Math Problem Bot), (I assume that) you (would) agree to this policy. If you do not agree, don't use this application!

## COPYRIGHT DISCLAIMER

When you submit a problem, quiz, etc. to this bot, you (the user of the bot) give me (ay136416 / rf20008) a royalty-free, worldwide, non-revocable, etc. license with enough rights to allow me to use this bot to process, store, show, etc. the problem in order for the bot to function properly. However, you don't necessarily transfer ownership to me, and you still get credit for this problem wherever the bot shows it.

## LIABILITY DISCLAIMER

I'm not liable for content this bot shows you. Sometimes I shut my bot off for development purposes (if I do, I usually notify you), but otherwise I'm not liable to anyone for that too. I try to get rid of bugs, but I'm not liable for them if they occur.
(In some places, I'm not allowed to legally disclaim liability. If you live in such a place, please ignore this section.)
(In some scenerios, laws might supercede this policy and I may still be liable. This is the case if there is no plausible interpretation of the law that says I am not liable to you. In those cases, I am still liable.)

## Why we store your data

Storing data you voluntarily submit to the bot, and data from the Discord API, is required for this bot to work.

## What data I store through this application

Data I store through this application include data from the Discord API, problems submitted, quizzes submitted, quiz problems submitted, deletion votes to problems, quiz submissions submitted. We may also store quiz gradings (and comments). 

## Disclosure of your data

Problems or quizzes will be shown to people who want to view your problems, and are in the same guild as the problem, or if the problem is a global problem and the user uses the bot.
Full problem data will be shown to people who solved a problem and used /user_data get_data.
Problem data (except the answers) will be shown to people who voted for a problem and used /user_data get_data
If other kinds of data are disclosed, then either I intend this (and will notify you and update this document accordingly), or it's a bug. If it's a bug, please notify me.

## Seeing and deleting your data

You can see *all* of your data using the command /user_data get_data.

As of right now, quizzes do not have a user interface, but problems you submit can still be deleted via ``/delete_problem``. Due to Discord limitations, you are not able to delete individual problems that are part of Discord servers are not a part of. There is also a ``/delete_all_my_data`` command, which will delete *all* your problems, quizzes, quiz submissions, and grades you submitted (including guilds you are not part of).

There are options to delete your votes & your solves

## Updates and notification

I may update this policy at any time. We don't store contact information (such as Discord usernames, emails, etc.), so we can't contact users individually. However, we can notify you through the official Discord server or through the bot's status.
