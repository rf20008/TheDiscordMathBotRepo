# Privacy policy

Most of the content in this privacy policy should be self-explanatory. (Write to me if it isn't!)
If you use this application (the Discord Math Problem Bot), (I assume that) you (would) agree to this policy. If you do not agree, don't use this application! The only data we'll store about you without your consent is whether you're blacklisted or not. By using this bot, you agree to us storing data about you in accordance with my Privacy Policy!


## Why we store your data

Storing data you voluntarily submit to the bot, and data from the Discord API, is required for this bot to work.

## What data I store through this application

Data I store through this application include data from the Discord API, problems submitted, quizzes submitted, quiz problems submitted, deletion votes to problems, quiz submissions submitted. We may also store quiz gradings (and comments). 

## Disclosure of your data

Problems or quizzes will be shown to people who want to view your problems, and are in the same guild as the problem, or if the problem is a global problem and the user uses the bot.
Full problem data will be shown to people who solved a problem and used /user_data get_data.
Problem data (except the answers) will be shown to people who voted for a problem and used /user_data get_data
If other kinds of data are disclosed, then either I intend this (and will notify you and update this document accordingly), or it's a bug. If it's a bug, please notify me.

## Seeing and deleting your data

You can see *all* of your data using the command /user_data get_data.

As of right now, quizzes do not have a user interface, but problems you submit can still be deleted via ``/delete_problem``. Due to Discord limitations, you are not able to delete individual problems that are part of Discord servers are not a part of. There is also a ``/delete_all_my_data`` command, which will delete *all* your problems, quizzes, quiz submissions, and grades you submitted (including guilds you are not part of). However, due to security reasons, we won't delete the data we store about you about whether you're blacklisted / trusted. 

There are options to delete your votes & your solves.

## Updates and notification

I may update this policy at any time. We don't store contact information (such as Discord usernames, emails, etc.), so we can't contact users individually. However, we can notify you through the official Discord server or through the bot's status.
