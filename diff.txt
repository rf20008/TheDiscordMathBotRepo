+### 2.1: A section about doxxing
+A general rule: You must not doxx anyone, including yourself, at any time! The **only** exception is when you achieve explicit written fully informed voluntary consent from the person you want to doxx.
+I advise the following: You should not even ask for consent to doxx someone, because it's extremely embarrassing and highly unethical.
+Also, when you ask for their consent, you must provide warnings such as the following:
+# 2.1.1: Warnings about doxxing you should provide
+* Beware: Doxxing is irreversible. It's very, very, very, very challenging to remove things from the Internet, and people might take screenshots, and do things. Deleting this might not be enough! YOUR DATA MIGHT STILL BE OUT THERE!!!!
+* Beware: When you are doxxed, your information is out there! People can do malicious things with it! They could go up to your house, they could spam your email, harrass you, impersonate you, or do similar evil things to you. (In no way am I condoning those activities.)
+* Beware: Depending on how you got the information, doxxing might be illegal! (Source: https://www.avg.com/en/signal/what-is-doxxing)
+* Beware: Doxxing can have a larger impact on the person who got doxxed's friends, family, and other close relationships.
+* Beware: Even if you obtain their consent before doxxing, you may still be punished.
+# 2.1.2: "I got doxxed! What can I do"?
+If you get doxxed, but not through my bot, then I can't help you. It is your responsibility to handle being doxxed (telling law enforcement authorities, blocking the person who doxxed you, reporting them, etc).
+If, however, it is through my bot, you should still pursue those activities (telling law enforcement, gathering evidence, blocking the person who doxxed you, reporting them, and things like that). Also, you should contact me ASAP. Be warned: I am still a high school student as of June 8, 2024. I do not know internet law. I might not see your message or respond to it, or be aware of it. I might not be able to help you. I might not be willing to help you (it's not that I have bad morals, but I might have homework to do, or other things.)
+
+Upon discovery, if you doxx someone, you will probably be immediately denylisted. Also, there are harsher consequences, including legal consequences, that you may be subject to.
+Also, you will probably be reported to Discord. I will not write more about this, because I am not a lawyer, and I do not know internet law.

 ### 3.3: COPYRIGHT DISCLAIMER
 
 When you submit anything that The Discord Math Problem Bot needs to process (i.e: problems, quizzes, appeals, responses, solutions) to this bot, you (the user of the bot) give me (ay136416 / rf20008) a perpetual, royalty-free, worldwide, non-revocable, etc. license with enough rights to allow me to use this bot to process, store, show, etc. the problem in order for the bot to function properly.

 Finally, you must not even distribute NSFW or NSFL content on my bot, because you will be subject to the same punishments (a possible denylist and being reported to Discord). There are harsher consequences, and you may be subject to them.

+### 4.4: Additional Monetization rules
+You must not monetize my bot without my explicit written permission that you must obtain beforehand (you cannot monetize my bot first, then ask me for permission later); this section does not override the other subsections of section 4, but it applies in addition to the other rules I set out.
 ## 5: When the law complicates stuff & Severability
 
 When the law complicates stuff & it invalidates parts of these Terms, only the smallest part that, when removed, makes the law not complicate **stuff and makes the rest of the Terms invalid, will be removed from the Terms.
