# Terms & Conditions
Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer.

Most of this language should be self-explanatory. Please create an issue if it isn't!

## Rules/things I have the right to do.

Trusted users (including me) reserve the right to blacklist people from the official instance of the bot for many reasons, including <ul>
<li> Sending NSFW/NSFL content through problems </li>
<li> Submitting copyrighted problems that are reported (or that they find)</li>
<li> Spamming the bot. The bot might ban you for spamming.</li>
<li> Disrespecting/targeting/etc people through problems.</li></ul>. Trusted users retain the right to use their own discretion about whether to ban a person.

The trusted users/guild administrators (if the problem isn't global) also have the right to delete problems submitted to the bot for many reasons, including <ul>
<li> Disrespecting/targeting/etc people through problems</li>
</li> Sending NSFW/NSFL content through problems</li>
<li> Sending copyrighted things that the author does not have the copyright of.</li>
</ul>. People with the authority to delete problems reserve the right to use their own discretion on whether to delete a problem or not. (This covers edge cases!)

## Disclaimers (because they don't belong in the Privacy Policy)
### LIABILITY DISCLAIMER

I'm not liable for the content this bot shows you. Sometimes I shut my bot off for development purposes (if I do, I usually notify you), but otherwise I'm not liable to anyone for that too. I try to get rid of bugs, but I'm not liable for them if they occur.
(In some places, I'm not allowed to legally disclaim liability. If you live in such a place, please ignore this section.)
(In some scenarios, laws might supersede this policy and I may still be liable. This is the case if there is no plausible interpretation of the law that says I am not liable to you. In those cases, I am still liable.)



### COPYRIGHT DISCLAIMER

When you submit a problem, quiz, etc. to this bot, you (the user of the bot) give me (ay136416 / rf20008) a royalty-free, worldwide, non-revocable, etc. license with enough rights to allow me to use this bot to process, store, show, etc. the problem in order for the bot to function properly. However, you don't necessarily transfer ownership to me, and you still get credit for this problem wherever the bot shows it.

# When the law complicates stuff

When the law complicates stuff & it invalidates parts of these Terms, only the smallest part that, when removed, makes the law not complicate stuff and makes the rest of the Terms invalid, will be removed from the Terms.

# Changes to the Terms

I may change the Terms at any time and for any reason. We won't notify you induvidually (because we don't store contact data about you with the express purpose of contacting you). However, we might use the bot's status/the official server/other ways to notify you. 

# Contributions/ Derivatives / Forks of the project

For legal reasons, those are licensed under GPLv3! The maintainers of the fork have the right to change these Terms, but the modified Terms do not apply to this version unless the changes are merged into the main version!
