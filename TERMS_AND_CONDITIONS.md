# Terms & Conditions
Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer. If you want legal advice, please ask a real lawyer.

Most of this language should be self-explanatory. Please create an issue if it isn't!

By using the application (The Discord Math Problem Bot), you agree to these Terms.

## Definitions
"us/we" means the people who develop/maintain The Discord Math Problem Bot (on the official instance, it's @rf20008)
"trusted users": people who have the trusted user status in the bot.
"the bot" means The Discord Math Problem Bot.
"me" means @rf20008.
"guild administrators" means people who have the 'administrator' permission in the guild.


## Rules/things I have the right to do.

Trusted users (including me) reserve the right to blacklist people from the official instance of the bot for many reasons, including: 
<ul>
<li> Sending NSFW/NSFL content through problems </li>
<li> Submitting copyrighted problems that are reported (or that they find)</li>
<li> Spamming the bot. The bot might ban you for spamming.</li>
<li> Disrespecting/targeting/etc... people through problems.</li>
<li> Exploiting bugs instead of reporting them. </li> </ul> <!---Note that the space prevents errors---> Trusted users retain the right to use their own discretion about whether to ban a person.

The trusted users/guild administrators (if the problem isn't global) also have the right to delete problems submitted to the bot for many reasons, including <ul>
<li> Disrespecting/targeting/etc... people through problems</li>
<li> Sending NSFW/NSFL content through problems.</li>
<li> Sending copyrighted things that the author does not have the correct rights to license to this bot. </li>
</ul> People with the authority to delete problems reserve the right to use their own discretion on whether to delete a problem or not. (This covers edge cases!) I also do not have control over guild administrators (as they are not me).

## Disclaimers (because they don't belong in the Privacy Policy)
### LIABILITY DISCLAIMER

I'm not liable for the content this bot shows you as I do not produce it. 
Sometimes I shut my bot off for development purposes (if I do, I usually notify you), but otherwise I'm not liable to anyone for that too. 
I try to get rid of bugs, but I'm not liable for them if they occur. However, in most serious cases, the law would supersede this.  
(In some places, I'm not allowed to legally disclaim liability. If you live in such a place, please ignore this section.)
(In some scenarios, laws might supersede this policy. In those cases, I will still be liable. This is the case if there is no plausible interpretation of the law that says I am not liable to you. In those cases, I am still liable.)

In most serious scenarios, the law would supersede this policy. I would still be liable in those cases.

### COPYRIGHT DISCLAIMER

When you submit a problem, quiz, etc. to this bot, you (the user of the bot) give me (ay136416 / rf20008) a royalty-free, worldwide, non-revocable, etc. license with enough rights to allow me to use this bot to process, store, show, etc. the problem in order for the bot to function properly. However, you don't necessarily transfer ownership to me, and you still get credit for this problem wherever the bot shows it.

## When the law complicates stuff

When the law complicates stuff & it invalidates parts of these Terms, only the smallest part that, when removed, makes the law not complicate stuff and makes the rest of the Terms invalid, will be removed from the Terms.

Inspiration: https://arcane.bot/tos

If this is not allowed, the above section is rendered null. If it's rendered null, when the law complicates stuff, it will be handled on a case-by-case basis instead.
## Changes to the Terms

I may change the Terms at any time and for any reason. We won't notify you individually (because we don't store contact data about you with the express purpose of contacting you). However, we might use the bot's status/the official server/other ways to notify you.

However, when the changes are significant, we will notify you, as required by U.S. law.

### Suggestions to the TOS

Suggestions to this are welcome (as of right now)! If you make any TOS changes that will affect people's usage of the bot, please let me know through the commit message. PR's containing TOS/Privacy policies will be considered more strictly.

## A disclaimer because of GPLv3

These Terms shall not be construed to prevent you from doing anything that the GPLv3 License allows you to do.  

## Contributions/ Derivatives / Forks of the project

For legal reasons, those are licensed under GPLv3! The maintainers of the fork have the right to change these Terms, but the modified Terms do not apply to this version unless the changes are merged into the main version!
Note that I am not liable for forks/modifications of this bot as I do not have control over them.
