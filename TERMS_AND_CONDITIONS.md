There was a recent update (that is hopefully the most recent update) on June 4, 2024.
# 0: Terms & Conditions
Disclaimer: As of January 5, 2024, I am a high school student making this discord bot for fun. I am *not* a lawyer. If you want legal advice, please ask a real lawyer.

Disclaimer 2: I didn't consult any legal advice while writing these Terms, or while modifying them, or revising them, or doing any step in the writing process of these Terms.
I am *not* experienced in crafting legally binding documents!

Most of this language should be self-explanatory. Please create an issue if it isn't!

By using the application (The Discord Math Problem Bot), you agree to these Terms. <br>
Note: This language of this document is quite informal.# 0: Terms & Conditions

Note: This language of this document is quite informal.


## 1: Definitions
* "us/we" means the people who develop/maintain The Discord Math Problem Bot (on the official instance, it's @rf20008)
* "trusted users": people who have the trusted user status in the bot. <br>
* "these Terms" refer to these Terms and Conditions. <br>
* "Discord's Terms and Conditions" (or "Discord's Terms") refer to Discord's terms and conditions. <br>
* "the bot" means The Discord Math Problem Bot. </br> 
* "I/me" means @rf20008 (but for *fork instances of the bot*, the pronoun" would not refer to @rf20008, but instead to the owner and runner of the fork. </br>
* "instances of the bot" refer to individual installations or versions of The Discord Math Problem Bot that are deployed and operated independently by users. Each instance represents a unique iteration of the bot's functionality, tailored to the specific needs or preferences of the user or community managing it. Instances include both the original version of the bot developed by the creator, as well as any forked or modified versions created by users under the terms of the GPLv3 license.
* "The main instance of my bot", or terms like that, refers to the instance of the bot that I run.
* "fork instances of the bot" refer to instances of my bot that I do not run. If someone forked my repository and ran a version of my bot from their computer, that instance would be considered a "fork instance of the bot". In particular, the main instance of my bot is not a fork instance of the bot. <br>
* "guild administrators" means people who have the 'administrator' permission in the guild. <br>
* "you" refers to any user of this bot, or any entity that accesses any part of The Discord Math Problem Bot in such a way that these Terms apply, or both. <br>
* "NSFW" stands for *N*ot *S*afe *F*or *W*ork. 
* "NSFL" stands for *N*ot *S*afe *F*or *L*ife.
## 2: Rules/things I have the right to do.

Trusted users (including me) reserve the right to deny-list users from the official instance of the bot for many reasons, including: 
<ul>
<li> Sending NSFW/NSFL content through problems </li>
<li> Submitting copyrighted problems that are reported (or that they find)</li>
<li> Spamming the bot. The bot might ban you for spamming.</li>
<li> Disrespecting/targeting/etc... people through problems.</li>
<li> Exploiting bugs instead of reporting them. </li>
<li> Using my bot to violate Discord's Terms of Service directly, or causing my bot to violate Discord's Terms of Service in such a way that is your fault</li></ul> 
<!---Note that the space prevents errors---> 
Trusted users retain the right to use their own discretion about whether to ban a person. 
Moreover, trusted users are not contractually required by these Terms to deny-list users who break either these Terms or Discord's Terms.



The trusted users/guild administrators (if the problem isn't global) also have the right to delete problems submitted to the bot for many reasons, including 
<ul>
<li> Disrespecting/targeting/etc... people through problems</li>
<li> Sending NSFW/NSFL content through problems.</li>
<li> Sending copyrighted things that the author does not have the correct rights to license to this bot. </li>
</ul> People with the authority to delete problems reserve the right to use their own discretion on whether to delete a problem or not. (This covers edge cases!) 
I also do not have control over guild administrators (as they are not me). They can enforce their own rules on which problems are acceptable.


## 3: Disclaimers (because they don't belong in the Privacy Policy)

### 3.1: NOT-A-LAWYER-DISCLAIMER
As mentioned earlier, I AM NOT A LAWYER! I DID _NOT_ OBTAIN _ANY_ LEGAL ADVICE WHILE WRITING THIS DOCUMENT!
I am only a 10th grader as of March 4, 2024. The purpose of this discord bot is, of course, to function, but more so, it is so that I can learn how to make a Discord bot.

I am NOT a lawyer. If you want any legal advice, you **_must_** ask a real lawyer.


### 3.2: LIABILITY DISCLAIMER

I'm not liable for the content this bot shows you as I do not produce it. 
Sometimes I shut my bot off for development purposes (if I do, I usually notify you), but otherwise I'm not liable to anyone for that too.

I try to get rid of bugs, but I'm not liable for them if they occur. However, in most serious cases, the law would supersede this.

(However, some bugs might be serious enough or cause guarantees of the ToS to not hold.
In those cases, this might not apply.)

(In some places, I'm not allowed to legally disclaim liability. If you live in such a place, please ignore this section.)
(In some scenarios, laws might supersede this policy. In those cases, I will still be liable. This is the case if there is no plausible interpretation of the law that says I am not liable to you. In those cases, I am still liable.)

In most serious scenarios, the law would supersede this policy. I would still be liable in those cases.

### 3.3: COPYRIGHT DISCLAIMER

When you submit anything that The Discord Math Problem Bot needs to process (i.e: problems, quizzes, appeals, responses, solutions) to this bot, you (the user of the bot) give me (ay136416 / rf20008) a perpetual, royalty-free, worldwide, non-revocable, etc. license with enough rights to allow me to use this bot to process, store, show, etc. the problem in order for the bot to function properly. However, you don't necessarily transfer ownership to me, and you still get credit for this problem wherever the bot shows it.

## 4: When the law complicates stuff

When the law complicates stuff & it invalidates parts of these Terms, only the smallest part that, when removed, makes the law not complicate stuff and makes the rest of the Terms invalid, will be removed from the Terms.
More succinctly: Any parts that are illegal are not in force. However **only** the parts that are illegal are not in force.
Inspiration: https://arcane.bot/tos

If this is not allowed, the above section is rendered null. If it's rendered null, when the law complicates stuff, it will be handled on a case-by-case basis instead.
## 5: Changes to the Terms

I may change the Terms at any time and for any reason. We won't notify you individually (because we don't store contact data about you with the express purpose of contacting you). However, we might use the bot's status/the official server/other ways to notify you.

When the changes are significant, I will try to notify you. I might forget.


### 6: Suggestions to the TOS

Suggestions to this are welcome (as of right now)! If you make any TOS changes that will affect people's usage of the bot, please let me know through the commit message. PR's containing TOS/Privacy policies will be considered more strictly.

## 7: GPLv3 disclaimer

These Terms shall not be construed to prevent you from doing anything that the GPLv3 License allows you to do.  
In other words, if the GPLv3 or later allows you to do something that my terms prevent you from doing, you can still do it.

You have the rights to copy, modify, analyze, run, distribute, etc my code, **but only as long as you follow the rules of the GPLv3**.
If you do not follow the GPLv3, you must not copy my code and take it closed sourced, or do any other interaction with my code.
## 8: Remember to follow the Discord ToS

As my bot is being hosted and run according to the Discord API and interacts with Discord in such a way that their terms apply, you must follow [Discord's Terms and Conditions](https://discord.com/tos).
You must not use my bot to break Discord's Terms of Service

## 9: Contributions/ Derivatives / Forks of the project

For legal reasons, those are licensed under GPLv3 or later! The maintainers of the fork have the right to change these Terms, but the modified Terms do not apply to this version unless the changes are merged into the main version!
Note that I am not liable for forks/modifications of this bot as I do not have control over them.

You have the rights to copy, modify, analyze, run, distribute, etc my code, **but only as long as you follow the rules of the GPLv3**.
If you do not follow the GPLv3, you must not copy my code and take it closed sourced, or do any other interaction with my code.

## 10: Termination
Note the tone change does not mean these following terms are less relevant or less applicable than normal! They still have **the same power** as the rest of these Terms!

Let's review what could cause you to be terminated.
### 10.1: What could cause you to be terminated?
Refer back to section 2. That section lists what could cause you to be deny-listed.

#### 10.1.1: What exactly is a deny-list?
A deny-list is a list of entities or individuals that are explicitly prohibited from accessing or using a particular service, syste, or resource.
In general, when someone is added to a deny list, they cannot access the full features of the service, and their rights are severely reduced.
Sometimes, being put on a deny list entails a complete and total ban!

#### 10.1.2: Connect it back to rf20008's Discord bot.
In the case of this discord bot, being put on our denylist prevents you from interacting with most commands. 
However, some commands are still available, like /user_data get_data, and /user_data delete_all.
Read further for what being denylisted actually entails. 

### 10.2: Who can deny-list me?

Only people with the trusted user status can denylist people, unless there's a bug with my bot.
The "trusted user" status is obtained by having another trusted user make you a trusted user. (I know, this might be abused!)
I am a trusted user, unless I remove my trusted user status.
Trusted users have the ability to do special commands, but we're concerned about denylists, so we'll focus on those.

### 10.3: How long is it? Can I do anything about it? Is there any appeal process?
By default, being put on the denylist is permanent, because I have not implemented a method to remove people after a certain time.
However, it is relatively easy to implement.

#### 10.3.1: What can I do about being denylisted?

An /appeal command exists, which is available to denylisted people, and allows you to submit an appeal.
However, it is *not* guaranteed that your appeal will be read or acted upon.
Also, you can be denylisted for making frivolous appeals.

### 10.4: What does a denylist entail?
To be denylisted means you lose access to certain features of the bot.
This includes commands such as /solve, /check_answer, and /help.
However, some commands, like /user_data get_data, and /user_data delete_all, are still accessible.
Being on the denylist restricts your ability to interact fully with the bot.


### 10.5: How will I know?

Currently, there is **no** real-time notification system to notify people that they've been deny-listed. This might change in the future.
The only way you will know whether you are deny-listed will be when you run a command that only non-denylisted users can run.


### 10.6: Contract termination???

When you are denylisted, you will only be able to interact partially with my bot, but you are not completely banned.
Therefore, the Terms of Service will still apply to you in the ways that you use this, and the Privacy Policy will still apply to you.

You are **still as free** as you were before to exercise your rights under the GPLv3 to my program. 
In particular, you can still make pull requests and issues (until there's a contribution agreement), look at my code as usual, copy it, modify it, run it, distribute it, analyze it.

However, you **must** follow the requirements of the GPLv3.


## 11: Selling stuff
Notwithstanding the relevant portions of the GPLv3 and applicable law, you must not sell things related to my bot.
This means, for example, that you must not sell problems, solutions, answers, votes, quizzes, answer keys, statuses, or things like that.

Also, even though these Terms do not explicitly disallow selling guild permissions, doing so is **extremely strongly *discouraged***, and may also be prohibited by Discord's Terms and Services (I didn't check).

The following sections go into more detail about selling other things, and why that is prohibited.
However, as a rule of thumb, you are not allowed to sell anything related to my bot, unless you're exercising your GPLv3 right to sell forks of the bot that you control and own.
### 11.1: Selling trusted user status
The following rule only applies to instances of my bot that are not fork instances of my bot:
* You must not sell trusted user status at all. This is because trusted user status is a moderation rank.
* You might be blacklisted for selling trusted user status.  Additionally, your trusted user status may be revoked.
The rationale for this rule is that I want to prevent disruptions to my bot.

### 11.2: Selling ownership is prohibited
The following rule only applies to instances of my bot that are not fork instances of my bot: 
* You must not sell ownership of my bot at any time. 
* However, if you're not a developer of my bot and you don't own this bot, then you shouldn't even *have* ownership of my bot *in the first place*, *ever*.

<br>
The following section deserves its own section because I said so.

#### 11.2.1: Rules on selling fork ownership
The following rules apply *only to fork instances of my bot* that are *not* the main bot.
* Please contribute to the OSS community. Therefore, it is *discouraged*, but *not banned*, to sell fork instances and make them private.
* As my bot is licensed under the GPLv3, which is a copyleft license, you must license your forks under the GPLv3 or any later version. Also, if you sell a fork, you must guarantee that they license their fork under the GPLv3 or any later version, and that they never change it.
* You still must provide the source code of your instance of your bot to any user upon request.
* Finally, you must follow the GPLv3.

### 11.3: You MUST NOT sell NSFW/NSFL content.
These rules apply to all instances of my bot, except those instances where this rule is removed. (If you are forking this bot, **PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, KEEP *AND* ENFORCE* this rule.) 
You must not sell NSFW/NSFL content anywhere on my bot. You may (and probably will ) be banned for this upon discovery. 
Also, you will probably be reported to Discord. 
Finally, you must not even distribute NSFW or NSFL content on my bot, because you will be subject to the same punishments (a possible denylist and being reported to Discord).

However, you don't necessarily transfer ownership to me, and you still get credit for this problem wherever the bot shows it.
Also, the license you give me will survive the termination of this bot.

## 4: Selling stuff
Notwithstanding the relevant portions of the GPLv3 and applicable law, you must not sell things related to my bot.
This means, for example, that you must not sell problems, solutions, answers, votes, quizzes, answer keys, statuses, or things like that.

## 5: When the law complicates stuff & Severability

When the law complicates stuff & it invalidates parts of these Terms, only the smallest part that, when removed, makes the law not complicate **stuff and makes the rest of the Terms invalid, will be removed from the Terms.
Also, the intent of the parties should be an important factor in deciding which part to remove.
More succinctly: Any parts that are illegal are not in** force. However **only** the parts that are illegal are not in force. Also, the intent of the parties will be considered. 

Inspiration: https://arcane.bot/tos

If this is not allowed, the above section is rendered null. If it's rendered null, when the law complicates stuff, it will be handled on a case-by-case basis instead.
## 6: Changes to the Terms

I may change the Terms at any time and for any reason. We won't notify you individually (because we don't store contact data about you with the express purpose of contacting you). However, we might use the bot's status/the official server/other ways to notify you.

When the changes are significant, I will try to notify you. Of course, I might forget.
It is possible that the only notification you will receive is a GitHub commit that has the diffs of my changes to these Terms. It is possible that you may receive no notification.


### 7: Suggestions to the TOS

Suggestions to this are welcome (as of right now)! If you make any TOS changes that will affect people's usage of the bot, please let me know through the commit message. PR's containing TOS/Privacy policies will be considered more strictly.

## 8: GPLv3 disclaimer

These Terms shall not be construed to prevent you from doing anything that the GPLv3 License allows you to do.

Currently, there is **no** real-time notification system to notify people that they've been deny-listed. This might change in the future.

### 11.6: Contract termination???

When you are denylisted, you will only be able to interact partially with my bot, but you are not completely banned.
Therefore, the Terms of Service will still apply to you in the ways that you use this, and the Privacy Policy will still apply to you.

In particular, you can still make pull requests and issues (until there's a contribution agreement), look at my code as usual, copy it, modify it, run it, distribute it, analyze it.

However, you **must** follow the requirements of the GPLv3.
