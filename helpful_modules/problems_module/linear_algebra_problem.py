if the solution is (var1, var2) = (3,4), the **only** correct answer is "3 4". Some teachers may ask you to answer in 
the form "(var name for all var names) = (ordered tuple)". For example, they may ask you to say "(var1, var2) = (3,
4)". However, this WILL NOT be accepted! Also, you cannot enter your answer in any other form. You cannot say "x=3, 
y=4" or "var1=3, var2=4", etc. They will not be parsed correctly. Remember that you cannot have **ANY** spaces in any 
of the tokens!!!! The reason for this extreme formatting format is that I don't want to have to parse many different
